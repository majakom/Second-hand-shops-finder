# Second hand shops finder
-- project in progress --

Command-line app created so that user can search for all second hand shops in a desired area using mostly geopy library by typing in their current address.
User can also chose to get their location based on their IP address. Based on that location user gets list of shops within desired distance previously typed into terminal.
User can save data about chosen shop from the list such as opening and closing hours, price per kilo in a specific day of the week. That data is later stored in a pickle file.
Later each user can chose from their personal database which shop is the most attractive to go to based on either current price or distance. The opening and closing hours can also be taken in consideration.
